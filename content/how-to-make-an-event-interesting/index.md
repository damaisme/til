- The MC should be interesting and engaging, more uplifting the better
- Ice breaking to make every single one of the audience become engaged. Make everyone think that everyone can do something about it. E.g. in devfest bandung today, the MC asked "three people whoever have the most coins in their pocket please go forward to the stage to receive a merchandise." and everyone started picking up their wallet to count the coins.
- Less filler words
- Confidence, body gesture play huge role
- user (audience) experience is the most priority. People loves free stuff. People don't like hassle. Reduce waiting time.
- Add more actual "content" instead of a fucking promotion with nothing actually said.
- Better audience flow for better navigation, less cognitive effort. Put signs for easy navigation. Like where is the toilet.
