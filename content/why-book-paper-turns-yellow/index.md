Book paper turns yellow primarily because oxidation of **lignin**. Lignin is a natural polymer that can be found in plants (polymer is a large molecules that made by bonding). It breaks down cellulose when exposed to air and light and caused the paper to discolor.

## Why some paper are slower to yellowing?

Higher quality paper has more lignin removed, so it will yellows slower than cheaper paper. This is why newspaper yellows faster.

There is a paper which is lignin-free that has pH 7 (neutral). The only downside of this paper is **expensive**. Wood-free paper is still using wood btw.

## How to make paper yellow slower?

We can't stop it from yellowing.

Avoid UV ray. Humidity is as bad as sunlight. The ideal is 30-50%. Direct exposure to AC can be damaging because the temperature changes.
