Electric Vehicles (EV) vs Internal Combustion Engine (ICE) vehicles:

- EV vehicles uses battery, ICE uses fuel
- EV zero emission, doesn't have tailpipe. 
- EV still produce emissions indirectly because the electricity generation comes from the power plants like coal. EV will be completely zero emission if the source energy is clean energy like wind or solar.
- EV is quieter.

## ICE

ICE cars burn gasoline or diesel which producing CO2, Nitrogen Oxide (NO2), Particulate Matter.

### Why ICE vehicles are vibrating so much compared to EV?

ICE rely on explosive combustion, burning fuel in cylinders, creating rapid pulses that moves the pistons back-and-forth motion. This motion converted to rotary motion via crankshaft. This process creates strong vibrations.

EV converts electrical energy into smooth rotational motion via electromagnetic. No explosions, pistons, or crankshaft.

EV has fewer moving parts.

### Pros and cons

EV:

- Eco friendly
- Cheaper 
- Higher initial cost
- Charging time
- Battery replacement

ICE:

- Affordable
- Quick refuel (though the queue exists)
- Reliable
- But polluting
- The sales will be banned in EU in 2035

In Norwegia, 90% of the source of energy are from hydropower, from water cycle. Converting potential energy stored in water behind the dam (bendungan) to kinetic energy by spinning turbines connected to generator.

Indonesia? still using coal, natural gas, oil.
