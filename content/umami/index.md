Umami (gurih) flavour is 5th taste alongside sweet, sour, bitter, and salt. This flavour can be found in natural source like seaweed, mushrooms, ripe tomatoes, etc. 

## Why we call it 'umami'

because japanese scientist discovered it when eating kelp broth (dashi) and it doesn't fit to the four tastes. He found an isolated chemical called ***glutamate*** and named it **umami**.

## Is it addicting?

No, it's not addicting, but craveable. Umami signals protein and the brain releases dopamine. It induce appetite drive because the flavor is so rewarding.
