Today I learned that bhutan is a private, landlocked country. Unlike North Korea that really lock themself geographically, politically, and even the tourism, Bhutan does not lock themself due to political issues, they only limit the tourism to prevent over-tourism.

Geographically, Bhutan is a himalayan country, located between China and India, quite close to Nepal.

Fun facts:

- Only 20-50 pilots allowed to land in Paro, Bhutan due to challenging approach to the Himalayas. This is an extreme level of airport landing.
- Bhutan limits their tourism because they want to preserve their culture. Unlike Bali or Thailand that have been westernized slowly, Bhutan still maintain their culture and traditions completely. Bali thirty years ago was cultural treasure with rice terraces, temples, and village life. Bali now is full with congested, traffic jams, and western bars. Bhutan neighbor, Nepal has the same problem. Kathmandu is now polluted and congested.
- They balance traditional values and modernization.

To travel to Bhutan, we need to use their authorized travel agent. They will take care of everything: visa, entry fee, guide fee.
